## 🎮 How to Play

### Objective
Survive for 60 seconds while avoiding all obstacles that come your way. Each obstacle you successfully dodge earns you points!

  - ➡️ Right Arrow: Move right

### Game Rules

1. Avoid Obstacles: Three types of obstacles will spawn randomly at the top of the screen:
    - 🚗 Red Cars: Fast-moving vehicles
    - 🚌 Purple Buses: Larger, harder to avoid
    - 🚧 Orange Blockers: Small road hazards

2. Scoring: 
    - +1 point for each obstacle that passes behind you
    - No points lost for close calls - only direct hits end the game

3. Increasing Difficulty:
    - Obstacle speed increases every 15 seconds
    - More obstacles spawn as the game progresses
    - Speed levels: 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 (at 45s, 30s, 15s, 0s remaining)

### Game Over Condition
The game ends when:
- Your car collides with any obstacle, OR
- You successfully survive the full 60 seconds (Victory!)

## 🏆 Scoring System

- Current Score: Displayed in the top-left corner
- High Score: Your best score ever (top-right corner) 
- Timer: Countdown from 60 seconds (top-center)
- Speed Level: Current difficulty level (bottom-left)

Your high score is automatically saved and will persist between game sessions.

## 🎯 Strategy Tips

1. Stay Mobile: Use all four arrow keys - vertical movement is just as important as horizontal
2. Watch the Spawn Pattern: Obstacles appear randomly, but staying near the center gives you more escape options
3. Speed Awareness: As the speed increases, start positioning yourself for quicker escapes
